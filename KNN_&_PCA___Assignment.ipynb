        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It is a non-parametric and instance-based learning algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "How it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "Given a query point, the algorithm finds the K nearest neighbors in the training dataset based on a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean).\n",
        "\n",
        "In classification, the majority label among the K neighbors is assigned.\n",

        "The Curse of Dimensionality refers to various problems that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of KNN:\n",
        "\n",
        "As dimensions increase, data points become sparse, making the concept of \"nearness\" less meaningful.\n",
        "\n",
        "Distance metrics lose effectiveness, causing KNN to perform poorly.\n",

        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms original features into new uncorrelated features (principal components) that capture the most variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Difference from Feature Selection:\n",
        "\n",
        "PCA creates new features (linear combinations), while feature selection selects existing features.\n",

        "\n",
        "Eigenvectors represent the directions (principal components) of the new feature space.\n",
        "\n",
        "Eigenvalues represent the magnitude of variance captured by each eigenvector.\n",
        "\n",
        "They are crucial because:\n",
